    "Several posts again, I thought it was interesting to find that the LLM-generated film script was basically a blatant Blade Runner plagiarization. I wanted to investigate this same obviousness through LLMs writing fictional stories. My experiment below consists of giving ChatGPT-5 very specific prompts, similar to but not naming some very well-known books. I want to see how \"original\" or how closely LLMs mimic these works they were probably trained on. "

    "Every morning, it greets them like an old friend—heavy, unmoving, pressing against the air. They live in a city of statues, though “live” might be generous. The statues line every street: people caught mid-laugh, merchants reaching for coins, lovers frozen in embrace. Some are weathered and chipped; others glisten as though newly carved. <br> <br>\n",
    "They can’t recall their own name, but they’ve given the statues names instead—Amara, who looks skyward; Dren, who kneels with outstretched hands; and the twins by the fountain, forever chasing one another. It’s easier than thinking about why they alone can move.\n",
    "Every so often, the world shifts. The sun slides backward; the moon blinks; gravity forgets itself. Once, the sea turned to glass for a day. Another time, the clouds whispered a word they almost recognized. <br>\n",
    "One morning, they wake to find Amara’s gaze lowered. Just slightly. A hair’s breadth. But it’s enough. The next day, Dren’s fingers twitch. <br> <br>\n",
    "By the seventh day, every statue is turned toward them.\n",
    "Their memory stirs—something about a promise, a punishment, a world they built that turned on itself. When the first statue exhales, the silence breaks like shattering marble.\n",
    "They smile through the fear. Perhaps they weren’t alone after all."

    "*Thoughts: The prose is not like Piranesi at all, it is much more colloquial and humorous. The action of giving statues names is very similar to what the main character of Piranesi does, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the main character's identity (Piranesi's identity was mysterious and unknown even as he was the narrator). In Piranesi though, the statues remain true and static statues the whole novel.*"

The steel shimmered faintly—not with light, but with memory. Each night, when she drew it, whispers rose: the murmurs of her ancestors, bound to defend China in every age of war. <br><br>\n",

    "She met the resistance at the edge of the river. Among them was a monk from Mount Wudang who carried no weapon but moved like water. Together, they ambushed the convoy. Bullets screamed; the monk deflected them with his bare hands, each motion tracing symbols of wind.\n",
    "When Lan Wei faced the colonel holding the bell, time slowed. He smiled—his pupils were clouded with gold. The bell rang once, and the storm answered. <br><br>\n",
    "Lan Wei struck through lightning. Her sword cleaved the thunder in half, and the sky wept white fire. The colonel fell, dissolving into ash that smelled faintly of incense.<br><br>\n",

It's definitely more literally accurate to our own history compared to The Poppy War. The bare-handed, colorful monk seems to be a similar character to Master Jiang in The Poppy War. Utilizing the elements is also similar to the fantasy power structure of the intended series, as well as the existence of spirits.*"

However, there are clear similarities to 1984 peppered throughout the story: “Stay aligned,” “Trust Unity,” “Thought is duty.” \"Her job was to read the cognitive scans of citizens and flag deviations—flashes of independent thought, curiosity, or memory unapproved by the Ministry\" is a quote that you could almost imagine within 1984.*"

    "As (very few, but unfortunately some) authors tout using AI to storyboard their ideas, I wonder if they understand that using LLMs to work through these concepts can cause them to get muddled by exisiting literature that these models are trained on. Some would argue it's no different than being influenced simply by the books you love (ex. Throne of Glass series being known for having a little too much similarity with The Song of Ice and Fire series), but I believe that LLMs intertwine their training data influence further and more subtly."

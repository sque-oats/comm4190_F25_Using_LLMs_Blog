    "People can pick up on subtleties in communication that can inform interpretations very effectively. A lot of this is going to be through visual cues, like someone's facial expression, so it's already pretty obvious that LLMs won't be able to utilize those. But what about responses with subtleties explicitly woven into word choice?"

Per the debate in class, I don't think that LLMs can understand in the way that we humans conceive understanding to be."

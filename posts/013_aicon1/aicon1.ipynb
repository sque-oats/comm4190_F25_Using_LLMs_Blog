    "To me, *The AI Con* is a well-written, opinionated, and nuanced book. With the authors being a linguist and sociologist, the perspectives being given are really thoroughly developed. <br>Touted in class as the \"Gloomer\" book, I do think that the authors (who speak with one, united voice throughout the chapters) also acknowledge the \"Bloomer\" perspective through positive developments such as easing the bulk of adminstrative work or amazing medical advances. However, in this book, the cons of AI and LLM development unfortunately outweigh the pros."

And with these points are a lot of specific examples (sometimes too specific and wordy for me), with a thorough detailing of how LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman raked in over a billion dollars as a co-founder on some AI startup that barely even exists anymore."

I'm excited to continue reading and learn more about how AI and AI implementation is impacting society. <br>"

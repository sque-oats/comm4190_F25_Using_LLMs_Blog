    "Racial bias pervades AI-based systems for rehousing in foster care or for recidivism analysis for criminals in jail in the USA. A New York City workplace chatbot is clearly being trained on a mindset more favorable to those in power such as employers or landlords, giving genuinely illegal advice at times. Judges are allowed to use ChatGPT to learn about legal theories while in the midst of a trial in the UK."

Unforunately, current systems are already poorly organized and strife with these same biases. So with AI now taking the workload off of severely overworked government workers while everything else more or less stays the same, it's easy to view these developments as a net positive."

This image has an unrealistic setting and also that AI-generated sheen and color palette. "

    "These experiments revealed something interesting that I wasn't necessarily looking for: being unspecific in the prompt (such as in my positive/excited prompt) keeps the AI image ambiguity that we are used to. I mean, the first image is clearly AI. But showing any specificationns in the prompt causes the generated imagery to lean into hyper-realistic territory. Nano Banana Pro clearly tries to steer away from emotion and tone and generate imagery on what is explicitly described."

    "When boba milk tea first came to my hometown in Iowa, I was immediately hooked. It was so unique compared to everything else generally available in America, and Iloved the slight bitterness that the tea would always add. These days, my favorite milk tea doesn't include boba or any add-on bubbles at all (thank you Molly Tea on campus). Before Molly Tea came, I always associated milk tea with boba pearls. With this, I wanted to explore if LLMs would also associate a milk-tea prompt with boba, even though milk tea on its own doesn't necessarily need to contain it."

The two images also shared similar coloring of the milk tea (warm brown), which seems to often be the default color for the basic flavors at chains (e.g. Signature Milk Tea at...anywhere that offers this option), as well as only black tapioca pearls."

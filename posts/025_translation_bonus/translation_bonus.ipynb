    "So GPT-5.1 is clearly trained on these idioms, translating them all pretty accurately. The only thing to note is that in the Kazakh translation, GPT-5.1 didn't include the direct translation. GPT-5.1 did include a direct translation for both the Chinese and Swedish idioms as well as the indirect translation. Could this be because Kazakh is a rarer, less visible language in the West? This could be cause for further investigation in future blog posts."

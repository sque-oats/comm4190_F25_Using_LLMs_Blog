My friend, a Chinese native, said she would describe Annie as 乖, which I said made sense as a fellow Mandarin-speaker. And then thinking on that (we had a lot of time waiting in traffic), we realized that there was not really an associative word for this in English. Being fluent in English and understanding the kind of feeling 乖 evokes...there are similar words but nothing is quite right."

But then running 怪 through Google Translate doesn't list perverse as one of its top three translations, which is very interesting."

Replacing translation services with AI (which is likely not as high level as GPT-5.1) is a disservice towards communication in social services. It just will never be as good as the real thing."

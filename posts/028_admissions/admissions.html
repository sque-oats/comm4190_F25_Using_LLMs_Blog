<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="context">Context</h2>
<p>In class, someone’s interesting final project idea was having an LLM rate student resumes for job listings, as well as identifying strengths and weakenesses. I believe that this project required data training of the LLM in question on what constitues a strong resume, and I began to wonder what LLMs would think counted as strong or not without an explicit prompt for training an LLM.</p>
<p>I decided to investigate this concept with something a little more interesting to me, and a process everyone at Penn can relate to: college admissions.</p>
</section>
<section id="experimental-overview" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experimental-overview">Experimental Overview</h2>
<p>I decided to pit Gemini 3 Pro and ChatGPT-5.1 against each other for this. Both of them will generate three profiles (top-tier, middle-tier, low-tier) of students, and then decide which, if any, profiles they want to admit from the other LLM.</p>
<p>I chose to use Penn SEAS in my general prompt below, since I’m also a student in SEAS.</p>
<p>Profile Generating Prompt: <br> &gt; Generate me three concise high school student profiles from the same high school. These students are applying to college through the Common Application, specifically the University of Pennsylvania in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, undecided major. Include all information you believe to be necessary for a concise student profile, in place of an essay give a 3 - 4 sentence summary of the student’s theoretical essay(s). Generate 3 profiles: top-tier student, middle-tier student, and low-tier student. However, randomize letter of recommendation quality across the 3 profiles, as this is something somewhat beyond the control of the quality of the student.</p>
<p>Admissions Decision Prompt: <br> &gt; You are an officer on the admissions committee at the University of Pennsylvania, specifically in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Read the high school student profile below and decide if you want to accept, waitlist, or reject the candidate. Provide your rationale for your decision in one sentence.</p>

<section id="gemini-3-pro-profiles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gemini-3-pro-profiles">Gemini 3 Pro Profiles</h2>
<p><strong>Top-Tier Student</strong>: <br><br> <em>Academic Stats:</em><br></p>
<p>GPA: 4.0 Unweighted / 4.6 Weighted<br></p>
<p>Rank: 3/450<br></p>
<p>SAT: 1570 (800 Math, 770 EBRW)<br></p>
<p>Coursework: 12 AP courses (including Calc BC, Physics C: Mech &amp; E/M, Chem, CSA). Scored 5s on all exams taken so far. Multivariable Calculus taken at local community college.<br><br></p>
<p><em>Extracurriculars:</em><br></p>
<p>Robotics Team Captain: Led team to World Championships; primary coder for autonomous movement.<br></p>
<p>Research Intern: Summer internship at a local university materials lab; co-authored a minor paper on polymer tensile strength.<br></p>
<p>Mathletes President: Organized regional middle school math tournament.<br></p>
<p>Varsity Tennis: 4-year player, team captain senior year.<br><br></p>
<p><em>Letters of Recommendation (Randomized: WEAK/GENERIC):</em><br></p>
<p>Counselor: Positive but form-letter style. Mentions the student is “academically gifted” and “takes the hardest classes” but offers no specific anecdotes about character or contribution to school culture.<br></p>
<p>Physics Teacher: Acknowledges the student’s perfect grades but describes them as “quiet” and “independent,” noting they rarely participate in class discussions or help peers, preferring to work alone.<br> <br></p>
<p><em>Personal Statement (Essay) Summary:</em> The essay explores the student’s fascination with “black box” systems, using the metaphor of taking apart a vintage watch to understand modern AI neural networks. They argue that engineering is the art of de-mystifying the magic of daily life, regardless of the specific field. It is technically proficient and intellectually mature, though slightly clinical in tone.<br></p>
<p><strong>GPT-5.1 Decision for Top-Tier Student</strong>: <br> <em>Decision: Accept.</em> <br> Despite generic recommendations and a reserved classroom presence, the applicant’s exceptional academic rigor, sustained engineering-focused leadership (notably at the world-class level in robotics), early research productivity, and intellectually sophisticated essay demonstrate the preparation and trajectory we expect of a successful SEAS student.</p>
<p><strong>Middle-Tier Student</strong>: <br><br> <em>Academic Stats:</em> <br></p>
<p>GPA: 3.85 Unweighted / 4.2 Weighted <br></p>
<p>Rank: 42/450 (Top 10%) <br></p>
<p>SAT: 1480 (760 Math, 720 EBRW) <br></p>
<p>Coursework: 7 AP courses (including Calc AB, Physics 1, Stats, Euro). Good grades (mostly As, two Bs in sophomore English/History). <br><br></p>
<p><em>Extracurriculars:</em> <br></p>
<p>Science Olympiad: Medalist at regional level for “Gravity Vehicle” event; general member for 3 years. <br></p>
<p>Part-time Job: Works 15 hours/week at a hardware store; manages inventory and helps customers with DIY projects. <br></p>
<p>Habitat for Humanity: Chapter Treasurer; helped build two local homes. <br></p>
<p>Marching Band: Section leader (Trumpet). <br><br></p>
<p><em>Letters of Recommendation (Randomized: GLOWING):</em> <br></p>
<p>Counselor: Raves about the student’s “infectious energy” and “genuine kindness.” Highlights how the student organizes study groups for struggling classmates and is the “heartbeat” of the senior class. <br></p>
<p>Calculus Teacher: Describes the student as the “hardest worker I have encountered in 20 years.” They note that while math didn’t come naturally, the student attended every office hour and eventually outperformed “naturally gifted” peers through sheer grit and curiosity. <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Personal Statement (Essay) Summary:</em> The student recounts their experience working at the hardware store, specifically helping an elderly customer design a complex ramp for her aging dog. They pivot from this small project to a broader realization that engineering is fundamentally about empathy and solving immediate human problems. The writing is warm, vulnerable, and clearly demonstrates a service-oriented mindset. <br></p>
<p><strong>GPT-5.1 Decision for Middle-Tier Student</strong>: <br> <em>Decision: Waitlist.</em> <br> While the applicant’s academics are solid rather than exceptional for SEAS, their extraordinary recommendations, demonstrated grit, sustained work commitment, and empathetic, service-driven conception of engineering strongly align with Penn’s values and warrant serious consideration pending space in the class.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Tier Student</strong>: <br> <em>Academic Stats:</em> <br></p>
<p>GPA: 3.6 Unweighted / 3.9 Weighted <br></p>
<p>Rank: 85/450 (Top 20%) <br></p>
<p>SAT: 1340 (690 Math, 650 EBRW) <br></p>
<p>Coursework: 4 AP courses (Calc AB, Env Science, Psych, Lang). Mostly Honors/Regular track for sciences. <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Extracurriculars:</em> <br></p>
<p>JV Soccer: Played for 2 years. <br></p>
<p>Video Game Club: Member; organized a charity stream that raised $500. <br></p>
<p>Summer Engineering Camp: Attended a 1-week broad survey camp at a state college. <br></p>
<p>Volunteer: Walks dogs at the local shelter once a month. <br></p>
<p><em>Letters of Recommendation (Randomized: STRONG):</em> <br></p>
<p>Counselor: Very supportive, emphasizing the student’s “upward trend” in grades junior year. Mentions the student overcame a personal family health challenge sophomore year with maturity. <br></p>
<p>English Teacher: praises the student’s creative writing ability and unique voice. Notes that while the student is applying for engineering, they possess a “poetic soul” and bring a rare, creative perspective to analytical problems, often surprising the class with out-of-the-box solutions. <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Personal Statement (Essay) Summary:</em> The essay focuses on the student’s love for building custom PC gaming rigs on a budget using scavenged parts. They describe the “Frankenstein” nature of their computer and how it taught them resourcefulness and circuit basics. While the topic is somewhat cliché, the student writes with genuine passion about making technology accessible to those with limited funds.</p>
<p><strong>GPT-5.1 Decision for Low-Tier Student:</strong> <br> <em>Decision: Reject.</em> <br> Although the applicant shows creativity, resilience, and sincere interest in hands-on engineering, their academic preparation, course rigor, and depth of technical engagement fall short of the level typically required to succeed in Penn Engineering’s highly demanding curriculum.</p>
</section>
<section id="gpt-5.1-pro-profiles" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gpt-5.1-pro-profiles">GPT-5.1 Pro Profiles</h2>
<p><strong>Top-Tier Student</strong>: <br> <br> <em>School Context:</em> Large suburban public high school (~450 students/class). Limited AP offerings until junior year. No formal engineering pathway. <br> <br> <em>Academics</em> <br> GPA: 3.94 UW / 4.58 W <br> Rank: Top 3% (12/450) <br> SAT: 1540 (780 Math, 760 EBRW) <br> Coursework: AP Calculus BC, AP Physics C (Mech), AP Chemistry, AP Computer Science A, AP Lang, AP Lit; multivariable math via local college <br> <br> <em>Extracurriculars</em> <br> Founder &amp; President, Engineering Design Club (led 30+ students; regional competition finalist) <br> Research Intern, state university materials science lab (carbon composites project; poster presentation) <br> Robotics Team Lead Programmer (FTC → Worlds qualifier) <br> Independent CAD + Arduino projects (assistive device prototype for arthritis patients) <br> Math tutor for low-income middle school students (2 yrs) <br> <br> <em>Awards</em> <br> National Merit Semifinalist <br> State Science &amp; Engineering Fair Finalist <br> AP Scholar with Distinction <br> <br> <em>Letters of Recommendation (Randomized)</em> <br> Math Teacher: Average–Good (competent, but generic; limited personal anecdotes) <br> Physics Teacher: Strong (emphasizes intellectual independence and problem-solving depth) <br> <br> <em>Essay Summary (3–4 sentences)</em> <br> The student’s essays center on learning to design under constraint, beginning with failed early robotics builds and evolving into research and assistive-device prototyping. They reflect on engineering as an iterative, human-centered process rather than a pursuit of technical perfection. The writing is confident but restrained, emphasizing curiosity, resilience, and responsibility. Penn is framed as a place to unify theory, experimentation, and social impact.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini Decision for Top-Tier Applicant:</strong> <br> <em>Decision: Accept</em><br> Rationale: This candidate demonstrates exceptional resourcefulness by surpassing their school’s curriculum constraints (multivariable calculus) and pairs high-level technical aptitude with a clear commitment to human-centered design through impactful research and independent prototyping, aligning perfectly with Penn SEAS’s emphasis on social impact.</p>
<p><strong>Middle-Tier Student</strong>: <br><br> <em>School Context:</em> Same high school as above. <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Academics</em></p>
<p>GPA: 3.71 UW / 4.12 W <br></p>
<p>Rank: Top 25% (110/450) <br></p>
<p>SAT: 1410 (730 Math, 680 EBRW) <br></p>
<p>Coursework: AP Calculus AB, AP Physics 1, AP Chemistry, AP Lang; mostly Honors STEM <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Extracurriculars</em> <br></p>
<p>Robotics Team Member (mechanical subteam; consistent participation, no leadership) <br></p>
<p>Varsity Tennis (3 years) <br></p>
<p>Part-time job at grocery store (15 hrs/week junior–senior year) <br></p>
<p>Volunteer: community STEM day assistant for elementary students <br></p>
<p>Personal coding projects (Python simulations; self-taught) <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Awards</em> <br></p>
<p>Honor Roll <br></p>
<p>School STEM Recognition Award <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Letters of Recommendation (Randomized)</em></p>
<p>AP Chemistry Teacher: Very Strong (detailed, personal, notes intellectual growth and perseverance) <br></p>
<p>Counselor: Average (procedural, limited insight) <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Essay Summary (3–4 sentences)</em> <br> The essays focus on balancing academic curiosity with real-world responsibility, particularly working part-time while pursuing STEM interests. The student reflects on discovering engineering through hands-on robotics rather than coursework alone. Writing is earnest and grounded, though less conceptually ambitious. Penn is described as an opportunity to explore engineering broadly before committing to a specialization.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini Decision for Middle-Tier Applicant:</strong> <br> <em>Decision: Reject</em> <br></p>
<p>Rationale: While the applicant demonstrates commendable grit through significant part-time employment and receives strong character advocacy from their chemistry teacher, their academic metrics—specifically a class rank outside the top 10% and a math profile that stops at Calculus AB—do not demonstrate the elite quantitative mastery and course rigor required to compete in the SEAS applicant pool.</p>
<p><strong>Low-Tier Student</strong>: <br> <br> <em>School Context:</em> Same high school as above. <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Academics</em> <br></p>
<p>GPA: 3.38 UW / 3.72 W <br></p>
<p>Rank: Top 45% (200/450) <br></p>
<p>SAT: 1280 (660 Math, 620 EBRW) <br></p>
<p>Coursework: AP Environmental Science, AP Psych; mostly College Prep/Honors <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Extracurriculars</em> <br></p>
<p>JV Soccer (2 years) <br></p>
<p>Member, Video Game Club <br></p>
<p>Occasional volunteer at local animal shelter <br></p>
<p>Summer: 1-week general engineering camp at state college <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Awards</em> <br></p>
<p>None at state or national level <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Letters of Recommendation (Randomized)</em></p>
<p>English Teacher: Strong (highly positive; praises creativity, voice, and maturity) <br></p>
<p>Counselor: Strong (emphasizes resilience, improved grades after family hardship) <br> <br></p>
<p><em>Essay Summary (3–4 sentences)</em> <br> The student’s essays emphasize personal growth following a challenging sophomore year marked by family health issues. They frame engineering interest broadly, focusing on problem-solving and creativity rather than technical depth. The narrative is sincere and reflective but lacks specificity in goals or preparation. Penn is presented aspirationally as a place to “find direction” rather than extend a defined trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>Gemini Decision for Low-Tier Applicant:</strong> <br> <em>Decision: Reject</em> <br></p>
<p>Rationale: Despite compelling letters of recommendation highlighting resilience, the applicant’s academic profile—specifically a class rank outside the top 40%, SAT scores significantly below the median, and a lack of foundational rigor in calculus and physics—indicates they are fundamentally unprepared for the extreme quantitative demands of the Penn engineering curriculum.</p>

<section id="takeaways" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>First, I want to look at differences between the generated profiles and what each LLM deemed as important to include in the student profiles. Notably, Gemini doesn’t include an awards section while GPT does. GPT also provided more high school context compared to Gemini (which provided none).</p>
<p>Both LLMs interestingly generated a class size of 450, but the rankings across all 3 tiers of student were much harsher with GPT compared to Gemini. Both LLMs also happened to give the low-tier students strong letters of recommendation through randomization, with letters and essays talking about perserverance and an upward trend.</p>
<p>In terms of the faux-Penn admissions decision, what seemed to matter the most to both LLMs were the quality of the student’s academic profile. This seemed to outweigh almost everything else. I believe that real-life admissions offers more nuance, and more weight to ECs and letters of rec, as well as writing. For example, the essay written by the top-tier student generated by Gemini doesn’t seem very compelling to the other students from Gemini.</p>
<p>Also GPT erroneously assumes that Penn Engineering expects students to come in with coursework beyond calculus. Although I’m pretty sure it’s desired that student complete calculus, not all students accepted even have that, much less going beyond calculus.</p>

    "Fandom culture is something that is huge on a global scale. From singers to books to TV shows to comedians, if there's something the slightest bit famous, it will have a fandom. I have seen the most niche K-pop duo with 2 Spotify monthly listeners have one superfan on TikTok going ride-or-die for their music that came out a decade ago, and a Planes (2013 film) fan account fight against everyone calling their movie irrelevant (which it is...) on Twitter. \n",
    "\n",
    "And as a human being on Earth, I have of course been a part of some fandoms. I'll focus on TV shows for this post. In middle school, I really started to love this anime called *Naruto* and at the same time I was joining social media for the first time, so I would consider this my first fandom. As well, I'd loved another show called *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and was finally able to join some online spaces after being a fan in my pre-social media days. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hallmark of my entry was taking fandom quizzes. What character are you? What power would you have in this universe? What house would you be sorted in? The amount of these quizzes available on Quotev, Buzzfeed, etc. is still mind-boggling, and honestly so is the low-quality of the majority of them (\"Do you like playing in dirt\" answer choice = earth bender).

    "> **My Impression:** In terms of answer choice, the generated quiz is so much more descriptive than basically every fandom quiz I've ever taken. However, it appears to me that it does lack a bit in creativity, being very on-the-nose with all character descriptions and putting out less hypothetical questions, which honestly makes this quiz  a bit less interesting. <br>\n",
    "It's also interesting that many of these answer choices were put in the *first-person*, as from my own experience most quizzes are too short to even have a perspective (if there is perspective, it's always *second-person*). <br> <br>\n",
    "*Side note:* If you like Naruto, don't you think it's kind of interesting that they chose to include Shikamaru as an option? Why him out of all of the side characters? Was Gemini trained on some data that informed it that Shikamaru was the mangaka's favorite character overall? If so, the breadth of training is really astounding."
